- Set if you also like to mine with battery / mobile data.

## Autostart Mining
Your device will start mining automatically.
It doesn't matter if the app is open or not. You will find a status message in the status bar.
Note if you use half of threads for mining and screen is locked, your device might stop the service.
If you like to run a stable mining you should only use 25% of CPUs.
